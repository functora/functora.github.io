Dear reviewers,

We thank you once again for your suggestions and feedback. In the revised
version of our paper "Selective Applicative Functors" we addressed your
suggestions, including one mandatory change, copied below:

=========================================================================
MANDATORY CHANGE: Please clarify your stance on the (non-)inclusion of
applicative/selective/monad, at it would be most helpful for the reader
who are likely to try and situate your work in the existing hierarchy.
=========================================================================

To clarify the applicative-selective-monad hierarchy, we added a new paragraph
on page 5 (line 220), which starts with "It is worth emphasising that...". We
also added Table 1 on top of the same page 5, which compares the expressive
power of the three operators in question (apply, select and bind). We hope that
you will find this change satisfactory. Please do not hesitate to get in touch
with us in case anything remains unclear.

Kind regards,
Andrey, Georgy, Simon and Jeremie
