<p class="padding-left">Haskell is my first programming language. I do have advanced level of Haskell including:</p>

- [GHC.Generics](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC.Generics), [generic-lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens) and [SYB](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/syb) for efficient data manipulation.
- [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) compiler, GHC [WASM](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/wasm.html) backend and [JSaddle](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/jsaddle) EDSL.
- [Presistent](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent) and [Esqueleto](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/esqueleto) typed SQL libraries.
- [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/) enterprise web framework.
- [Miso](https://haskell-miso.org/) frontend web framework.

<p class="padding-left">Rust is my second programming language, but nowadays I often prefer it over Haskell due to its superior performance and better development experience. I do have good level of Rust including:</p>

- [Chumsky](https://crates.io/crates/chumsky) parser combinators.
- [Diesel](https://crates.io/crates/diesel) typed SQL library.
- [Dioxus](https://crates.io/crates/dioxus) cross-platform apps framework.

<p class="padding-left">I am also qualified in other useful areas:</p>

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) - Strong medium level. Nix is the best tool for deterministic builds, tests and development environments. I am using NixOS daily.
- [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) and [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) - Advanced level as application developer (not as protocol developer). Bitcoin is the greatest achievement of the new millennium, which brings financial freedom and sovereignty back to the people.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) - Strong medium level. I am not database expert, but I am using everything what software developer should use to manipulate data storage. Queries, transactions, joins, locks.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) - Advanced close to expert level. I am using Docker and Swarm for development, builds and production. Docker is a very handy tool for MacOS and Linux compatibility.
