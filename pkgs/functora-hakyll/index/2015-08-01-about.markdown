<p class="padding-left">I am pseudonymous software developer 21it. I do specialize in a software development with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [Nix](https://nixos.org/) programming languages since 2019. I work with passion and create the best software using the best technologies. My areas of expertise and interest are [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), sound money, trading, free markets, privacy and sovereignty. From technical side my primary values are compile-time guarantees of software correctness, safety and efficiency, which results in usage of advanced type systems, type-level programming and compile-time programming.</p>
