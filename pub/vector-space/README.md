This package provides provides classes and generic operations for additive groups, vector spaces and affine spaces.
It also defines a type of infinite towers of generalized derivatives, as described in the paper [*Beautiful differentiation*](http://conal.net/papers/beautiful-differentiation/).
A generalized derivative is a linear transformation rather than one of the common concrete representations (scalars, vectors, matrices, ...).
The representation of linear maps uses the [MemoTrie](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/MemoTrie) package.
