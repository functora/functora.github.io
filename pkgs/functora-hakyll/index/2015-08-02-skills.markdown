<p class="padding-left">Haskell is my primary and the most favorte tool. I do have advanced level of Haskell including:</p>

- Tagless final encoding, monad transformers, lifting and unlifting for efficient effects management.
- DataKinds for better phantom type parameters and [Singletons](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons) for dependent type programming.
- [Lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens) for efficient data manipulation and parsing.
- [Units](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/units) for dimential analysis.
- Template Haskell and Quasiquotation for compile-time computations.
- [Presistent](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent) and [Esqueleto](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/esqueleto) typed SQL drivers.
- [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/) enterprise web framework.

<p class="padding-left">I am also qualified in other useful areas:</p>

- Nix - Strong medium level. Nix is the best tool for deterministic builds, tests and development environments.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Strong medium level. I am not database expert, but I am using everything what software developer should use to manipulate data storage. Queries, transactions, joins, locks.
- Bitcoin and Lightning Network - Advanced level as application developer (not as protocol developer). Bitcoin is the greatest achievement of the new millennium, which brings financial freedom and sovereignty back to the people.
- [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/) - Expert level. I am using Dhall configuration language as safe and typed alternative to YAML, JSON and XML.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) - Advanced close to expert level. I am using Docker and Swarm for development, builds and production. Docker is a very handy tool for MacOS and Linux compatibility.
- Linux - Strong medium level. Definitely not a Linux guru, but happily using it every day.
